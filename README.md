### Kubernetes in Production

- Best practices for managing production clusters
- Disaster recovery and backups
- Scaling clusters and ensuring high availability

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with Docker and containerization concepts
- Basic understanding of YAML syntax
- Access to a Kubernetes cluster (local or cloud-based)

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd kubernetes-zero-to-hero
```

### Install Required Tools:

- `kubectl`: Command-line tool for Kubernetes
- `Minikube`: Local Kubernetes setup

### Follow the Learning Plan:

Navigate through daily tasks and examples to build your knowledge step-by-step.

## Example: Creating a Deployment

### YAML File: `mysql-pod.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mysql-pod
  labels:
    app: mysql
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mysql
    image: mysql:5.7
    env:
    - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
      value: rootpassword
    ports:
    - containerPort: 3306
```

### Commands:

```bash
# Apply the manifest
kubectl apply -f mysql-pod.yaml

# Check the Pod
kubectl get pods

# View logs from the Pod
kubectl logs mysql-pod
```
